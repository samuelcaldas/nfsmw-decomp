objdiff allows one to map symbols from the target binary to the source binary.
this script will take those symbols you have mapped, and write them to `symbols.txt`.

use case: say you have changed the signature/name of a function.
now, your source file says `foo_Ful`, but symbols.txt says `bar__Fl`.
objdiff allows you to map the `foo_Ful` in the target object to `bar__Fl` in the source object.
this script allows you to replace `foo_Ful` with `bar__Fl` in `symbols.txt`.
